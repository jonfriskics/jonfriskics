### Hello friend.

- I'm Jon
- I'm currently leading a small team and working on **products** and **resources** that empower **technology teachers and content creators**, which we call Authors, at Pluralsight.
- I came to Pluralsight via Code School (acquired 2014), where I created content, strategy, and products for best-in-class interactive learning experiences.
- I've created engaging video and interactive content for learning technology skills on topics like iOS (Objective-C and then Swift), Angular, React, HTML/CSS, and Docker, and been fortunate enough to guide and coach subject matter experts through creating dozens of other courses.
- I've presented at conferences and meetups about iOS development, web development, instructional design, and edtech.  In my prior career in academia, I co-authored several papers on innovating in education with technology.
