### Hello friend.

I'm Jon.

I'm currently working on **products** and **resources** that empower **technology teachers and content creators**, which we call Authors, at Pluralsight.

I came to Pluralsight via Code School (acquired 2014), where I created content, strategy, and products for best-in-class interactive learning experiences.

I've created engaging video and interactive content for learning technology skills on topics like iOS (Objective-C and then Swift), Angular, React, HTML/CSS, and Docker, and been fortunate enough to guide and coach subject matter experts through creating dozens of other courses.

I've presented at conferences and meetups about iOS development, web development, instructional design, learning and edtech.  In my prior career in academia, I co-authored several papers on innovating in education with technology.

Most of the code I've written in the last few years I'm not able to share publicly here.

#### How to contact me

I've intentionally been limiting social media for the past few months/years, but I can sometimes be found on 🐦 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jonfriskics) and 🕴[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-friskics-961a077)

I can also be reached by email at [jonfriskics@gmail.com](jonfriskics@gmail.com).
