## Hi, I'm Jon.

I'm interested in learning products and content, especially **products** and **resources** that empower **technology teachers and content creators**.

In my time at Pluralsight and Code School (acquired 2014), I created content, strategy, and products for best-in-class interactive learning experiences.

I've created engaging video and interactive content for learning technology skills on topics like iOS (Objective-C and then Swift), Angular, React, HTML/CSS, and Docker, and been fortunate enough to guide and coach subject matter experts through creating dozens of other courses.

#### How to contact me

I've intentionally been limiting social media for the past few years, but I can sometimes be found on 🐘 [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jonfriskics) and 🕴 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-friskics-961a077)

I can also be reached by email at [jonfriskics@gmail.com](jonfriskics@gmail.com).
